                    <p>
                        As a sixth-semester student of Software Development at the IT-University of Copenhagen, I have hands-on experience in web development, databases, and algorithms. I have gained a strong foundation in the following programming languages:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>C#</li>
                        <li>Golang</li>
                        </ul>
                        My coursework has honed my problem-solving skills and solidified my passion for technology. My helpful and enterprising nature, with solid communication skills, make me a valuable addition to any team.
                        <br />
                        When not coding, I can be found at the local gym or in the student-run Caf√© called Analog. After volunteering as a barista and former vice-chair, I may have become somewhat addicted to coffee, and it is therefore essential to my coding routine ‚òïÔ∏è
                        <br />
                        I am currently learning:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reflections on IT ü§î</li>
                            <li>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ü§ñ</li>
                        </ul>
                        Additionally, I am working on my bachelor project titled "Hand-Gesture-Based Interaction in Hybrid Meetings."
                        <br />
                        Feel free to connect, and let's see how our paths may cross in the future üîú
